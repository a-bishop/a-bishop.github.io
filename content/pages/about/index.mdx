Hey, thanks for visiting my site.

I'm a full-stack web developer working at [Stocksy United](https://stocksy.com), a
[platform cooperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_cooperative) where
I build tools to improve user engagement and search performance. I have
production experience with a number of technologies, including React, TypeScript,
Node, Ruby, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and AWS cloud services.

I like to tinker on small side projects to learn new technologies. Check out the
latest on the <Link className='internal-link' to='/projects'>projects</Link>
page. My GitHub account with all the source code can be found
[here](https://github.com/a-bishop).

In my spare time I enjoy
[playing music](https://chancelovett.bandcamp.com/releases), hiking, travelling,
reading and listening to podcasts.
