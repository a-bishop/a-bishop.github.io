Hey, thanks for visiting.

I'm a web developer working at [Stocksy United](https://stocksy.com),
a [platform cooperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_cooperative)
where I build search features and other tools to help photographers and videographers sell their art
online. I have production experience with React, TypeScript, Node, GraphQL, PHP, Ruby, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Solr and various AWS services.

I occasionally write [blog posts](/blog) about things I'm working on or learning about. I also like to tinker on small side projects to learn new technologies â€“ check out the latest on the [projects](/projects) page. My GitHub account with all the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/a-bishop).

In my spare time I enjoy [playing music](https://chancelovett.bandcamp.com/releases), hiking, travelling, reading and listening to podcasts.
