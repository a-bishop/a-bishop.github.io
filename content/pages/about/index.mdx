Iâ€™m a full stack web developer with production experience in React, Typescript,
Node, Ruby, PHP, MySQL and PostgreSQL, as well as with AWS services such as
Lambda, Cognito, API Gateway and Redshift. I work at
[Stocksy United](https://stocksy.com) where I build tools to improve user
engagement and search performance.

Check out the <Link className='internal-link' to='/projects'>projects</Link> page to see some demos of my
latest side projects. My GitHub account with all the source code can be found
[here](https://github.com/a-bishop).

In my spare time I enjoy
[playing music](https://chancelovett.bandcamp.com/releases), reading, listening
to podcasts and travelling.
