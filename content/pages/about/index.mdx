Greetings!

I'm a developer from the west coast of Canada with experience crafting software solutions for businesses using modern web technologies. I currently work at [Stocksy United](https://stocksy.com) where my focus is on full-stack product development with TypeScript, React, Node, PHP and AWS Serverless.

I occasionally write [blog posts](/blog) about things I'm working on or learning about. I also like to tinker on small side projects to learn new technologies â€“ check out the latest on the [projects](/projects) page. My GitHub account with all the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/a-bishop).
