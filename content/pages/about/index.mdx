Greetings.

I'm a developer from the west coast of Canada with experience creating software solutions for businesses using modern web technologies. I currently work at [Treez](https://www.treez.io/), a commerce platform for cannabis retailers, where my current focus is on API and product development using AWS Serverless (Lambda, API Gateway, Event Bridge), Postgres, TypeScript and React.

I occasionally write [blog posts](/blog) about things I'm working on or learning about. I also like to tinker on small side projects to learn new technologies â€“ check out the latest on the [projects](/projects) page. My GitHub account with all the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/a-bishop).
