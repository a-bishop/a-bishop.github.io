What are the `field()` and `elt()` functions used for in MySQL? I recently came across them when implementing a voting system and found them to be pretty useful for calculating min and max values from queries with `group by` clauses.

Let's assume we have a database table `user_membership` that records users and the memberships they belong to within an organization. A user can have multiple memberships (ie. there is a one-to-many relationship between users and memberships). Here are a few example rows from our contrived database table:

| id  | userId | membership |
| --- | ------ | ---------- |
| 1   | 101    | board      |
| 2   | 101    | staff      |
| 3   | 102    | staff      |
| 4   | 102    | general    |
| 5   | 103    | general    |
| 6   | 104    | general    |

We can see that user 101 is a member of 'board' and 'staff', user 102 is a member of 'staff' and 'general', and user 103 and 104 have 'general' memberships.

Now let's say we have a request from an analyst to retrieve the number of users by membership, but only counting users once by their priority membership ("board" > "staff" > "general"). In MySQL, we can achieve this by using [the `field()` function](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-functions.html#function_field) and a subquery. The `field()` function will return the index position of a value (the first argument to the function) in a list of values (the following arguments to the function).

```sql
SELECT userId, membership AS priorityMembership FROM user_membership
WHERE field(membership, "board", "staff", "general") = (
  SELECT min(field(membership, "board", "staff", "general"))
  FROM user_membership t
  WHERE t.userId = user_membership.userId
)
GROUP BY userId;
```

However, there is a better way to achieve this same calculation which doesn't rely on a subquery. The [`elt()` function](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-functions.html#function_elt) allows us to convert the index value back to the corresponding string at the index number specified in the list of arguments.

```sql
SELECT
    userId,
    elt(min(field(membership, "board", "staff", "general")), "board", "staff", "general") AS priorityMembership,
    min(field(membership, "board", "staff", "general")) AS priorityMembership_integer
FROM user_membership
GROUP BY userId;
```

| userId | priorityMembership | priorityMembership_integer |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 101    | board              | 1                          |
| 102    | staff              | 2                          |
| 103    | general            | 3                          |
| 104    | general            | 3                          |

From there, we can easily count the numbers for our analyst by grouping on priority membership.

```sql
SELECT priorityMembership, count(userId) as userCount
FROM (
  SELECT
      userId,
      elt(min(field(userGroup, "board", "staff", "general")), "board", "staff", "general") AS priorityMembership,
      min(field(userGroup, "board", "staff", "general")) AS priorityMembership_integer
  FROM user_membership
  GROUP BY userId
)
GROUP BY priorityMembership;
```

| priorityMembership | userCount |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| board              | 1         |
| staff              | 1         |
| general            | 2         |

A couple of gotchas to note about the `field()` and `elt()` functions:

- the indexing starts from the first argument to the function. `SELECT elt(3, 'banana', 'apple', 'orange');` will return 'orange' while `SELECT field('banana', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange')` will return 1.
- `elt()` Returns NULL if the first argument is less than 1 or greater than the number of arguments.
- `field()` returns 0 if the first argument is NULL because NULL fails equality comparison with any value.
