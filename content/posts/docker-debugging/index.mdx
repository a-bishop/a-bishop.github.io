I recently went through the painful process of debugging a docker container rebuild and thought I would share some things I learned along the way.

things to talk about:

Dockerfile
docker-compose file

docker run
docker build
docker commit
docker push

docker exec

overriding command / entrypoint
running interactive shell

docker logs
docker events&

docker pause 
docker unpause

docker top
docker inspect
