For those instances when it's impractical or impossible to re-architect an existing web application in React Native, the framework allows us to simply embed these web pages in our apps with the WebView component. Let's look at some of the functionality exposed through the WebView API.

#### Getting started

The React Native team is planning the [imminent removal of WebViews](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/webview) from the core library as part of its efforts to reduce the framework's size. As a result, we'll need to import the WebView component from a separate package, namely `react-native-webview`. So, let's `npm install` it into our existing React Native project to get started.

```bash:noLineNumbers
npm install react-native-webview
```

Then, import it into the component where we'd like to render a WebView.

```jsx
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';
```

Using the WebView component couldn't be easier. Just pass it a `source` prop, which will be an object with key of "uri" and a value of the web address to render in the component.

```jsx
<WebView source={{ uri: 'https://example.com' }} />
```

#### Useful WebView Properties and APIs

Once we have the WebView component set up, maybe we want to show users a placeholder while it is rendering. For this, we can hook into the `onLoadProgress` prop and use the progress attribute of the `nativeEvent` object to determine how long to display our placeholder, which in this case is an `ActivityIndicator` component.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { ActivityIndicator, View } from "react-native";

const WebViewComponent = () => {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0.0);

  return (
    <>
    <WebView
        source={{ uri: "https://example.com" }}
        onLoadProgress={event => {
          setProgress(event.nativeEvent.progress);
        }}
    />;
    {
        progress < 0.99 ? (
        <View style={{ justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}>
            <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="khaki" />
        </View>
        ) : null;
    }
    </>
  )
};
```

Another useful prop when working with WebViews is `onNavigationStateChange`. With this prop, we can expose an object representing the navigation state of the component, which will let us do things like create custom forward and back navigation buttons and listen for url changes. To use this prop, you'll also need to define a `ref` to uniquely identify the instance of the WebView.

```jsx
import { Button } from 'react-native-elements';
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Dimensions } from 'react-native';
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';

const WebViewComponent = () => {
  const [canGoBack, setCanGoBack] = useState(false);
  const [canGoForward, setCanGoForward] = useState(false);
  const [currentUrl, setCurrentUrl] = useState('');

  const { width } = Dimensions.get('window');

  const wvRef = useRef();

  function backHandler() {
    if (wvRef.current) wvRef.current.goBack();
  }

  function forwardHandler() {
    if (wvRef.current) wvRef.current.goForward();
  }

  // listen for url changes and trigger an action on certain endpoint
  useEffect(() => {
    if (currentUrl.match(/\/my-target-endpoint\//)) {
      console.log(currentUrl);
    }
  }, [currentUrl]);

  return (
    <>
      <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', height: 50, width: width }}>
        <Button
          title="< Back"
          disabled={!canGoBack}
          onPress={backHandler}
          accessibilityLabel="Go back"
        />
        <Button
          title="> Forward"
          disabled={!canGoForward}
          onPress={forwardHandler}
          accessibilityLabel="Go forward"
        />
      </View>
      <WebView
        ref={wvRef}
        source={{ uri: 'https://example.com' }}
        onNavigationStateChange={(navState) => {
          setCanGoBack(navState.canGoBack);
          setCanGoForward(navState.canGoForward);
          setCurrentUrl(navState.url);
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

One of the most powerful features of WebViews is the ability to inject JavaScript to do things like remove page elements, disable buttons, and attach event handlers to the JavaScript code within the page. For this functionality there are two props that the WebView can take, `injectJavascript` and `injectedJavascript`.

`injectedJavascript` only gets evaluated once on load of the WebView, so for most use-cases you'll probably want to use the `injectJavascript` function, which injects the script programmatically every time the `ref` changes. Used in conjuction with the `onMessage` and `postMessage` APIs, it's possible to create two-way communication channels between the React Native code and the WebView. In the example below, the component communicates to React Native when it detects that a user has submitted a form element on the page.

```jsx
import { useRef, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';

// needs to be wrapped in a setTimeout function to add the js to the event loop
const jsToInject = `
  setTimeout(() => {
      document.getElementById("submit-form").addEventListener("submit", function(){
          window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage("yahhh! form submitted")
      });
  }, 0);
`;

const WebViewComponent = () => {
  const [formSubmitted, setFormSubmitted] = useState(false);

  const wvRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (wvRef.current) {
      wvRef.current.injectJavaScript(jsToInject);
    }
  }, [wvRef]);

  return (
    <>
      <WebView
        ref={wvRef}
        source={{ uri: 'https://a-page-with-a-form.com' }}
        onMessage={(event) => {
          console.log(event.nativeEvent.data); // "yahhh! form submitted"
          setFormSubmitted(true);
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

#### Conclusion

WebViews are not the most performant way to write a React Native application, but they provide a useful bridge between web interfaces and React Native code when it would be impractical to fully rebuild the interface natively. Luckily, the WebView component exposes many useful APIs to make this transition more seamless.

Hopefully this post has given you some ideas for how to integrate a WebView into your next React Native application. Check out the [React Native WebView API reference docs](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview/blob/master/docs/Reference.md) for more ideas and examples.
